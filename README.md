# Canadian Web Services

## Synopsis

This is a QGIS plugin to load a subset of Canadian geospatial web services that are open and available.  It is populated from an evergreen list of services harvested weekly from the .ca landscape. It then allows the user to add all layers of each service and retain the service connection in the user profile for later use.

Discovery of relevant datasets remains a key barrier to the uptake of use of GIS for decision-making.  The GeoConnections program at Natural Resources Canada is working to address this.
Fundamental to this is encouraging the use of standards and completion of accurate metadata.
This plugin may reveal useability issues that may exist with some services and service providers.
