## Synopsis

Discovery of relevant datasets remains a key barrier to the uptake of use of GIS for decision-making.  The GeoConnections program at Natural Resources Canada is working to address this.
Fundamental to this is encouraging the use of standards and completion of accurate metadata.
This plugin is an aid to viewing Canadian web services (see below for what types) that are open and available.  It currently is populated with a list of services harvested weekly from the .ca landscape.
It then allows the user to efficiently add all layers of selected services* and retain the service connection in the user profile for later use.

This code is provided under MIT License.  A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices.

2. Wait for service list to be populated over the internet.
